# Coding-Competitions
compilation of source codes from past programming competitions
Just uploaded a bunch of source code from different problems I've worked on from some programming competitions in the past. Time constraints in the competition made it a priority to code quick and not for the code to look pretty, so keep that in mind. I'll try to make different code that's more appealing to the eye in the future, but I won't be changing any of this code, since it's straight from the competition submissions.
Code is from the following competitions:

-Microsoft Coding Competition / 2 hours (September 21, 2017): Team of 3
  9th out of ~70 teams
 -IEEEXtreme Coding Competition / 24 hours (October 13/14, 2017): Team of 3
  Top 12% out of around ~3500 teams
